I ran across this [printable calendar] on Mastodon and thought it a lovely idea.

For Jan 1, the task is to find 3 things to look forward to this year.  Here's my shot at the
list:

-   taking my wife on her dream birthday adventure to Diagon Alley at Universal

-   learning how to cook anything from my Mom

-   creating safe community for my daughter online with my [gemini social media project]
