<dl>
  <dt>Jan 3</dt>
  <dd>Do a kind act for someone to brighten their day</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Plan</dt>
  <dd>I may take this one more extemporaneously.  But if not, probably something nice for my wife
  in the morning, like making breakfast or getting the kiddo dressed.</dd>

<dl>
  <dt>How it went</dt>
  <dd>Well, I didn't have a lot of opportunities today, but I did make up a bit for
  yesterday and watched a "What If..." episode and one of my daughter's favorite Disney
  franchises (Zombies 2) with her.  We talked about the money she made cat-sitting for our
  neighbors and how I reverse-borrowed a tenner from her by putting a twenty in her piggy
  bank and taking a ten.  So my cheese-out nice thing was to "forgive" the ten I was still
  owed, effectively giving her the money.  She was grateful, so I suppose it counts.</dd>
