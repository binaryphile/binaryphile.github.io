So I've seen a few shells in my time...everything from the venerable
[4DOS] and csh, to the modern zsh and [fish] \(my personal favorite\).

Even so, I'm not ashamed to say that I love bash. Or rather, I love
making bash work for me. Bash itself is pretty old, and not all that
loveable. I don't really care. It's everywhere, and it's good enough. I
work on a lot of systems, many of them production. My job isn't to turn
them into my own personal playground...I get paid to work on systems
with others, and that means taking the system as it comes.

In short, if you work with linux systems, you aren't doing yourself any
favors by *not* knowing bash inside and out. And once you do, you'll
find that you don't need to reach for many other tools a lot of the
time.

But I'm not blogging to explain everything there is to know about bash.
I've written a pretty decent series on approaching bash already (see the
blog index). I'm going to try to write some short entries on how I use
bash. Follow me if you will...

See [part 2], *I Was Scared Of Bash*.
