Time to get back in the saddle with blogging.

The older I get, the more I realize how difficult it can be to articulate myself.  When I
have something to write about, it gives me focus and forces me to examine the structure of
my own thinking.  I don't have enough opportunity to do writing in my job, so if I am to
progress in rectifying my somewhat poor communication skills, I need another forum to do so.
So I'm making another run at blogging, in the hopes of improving those skills, but also
trying to lower the anxiety threshold and keep it light, to go wherever my interest takes
me.

Day 1.

"Write what should not be forgotten."
- Isabelle Allende

"One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple."
- Jack Kerouac

"Start writing, no matter what.  The water does not flow until the faucet is turned on."
- Louis L'Amour

"Just write every day of your life.  Read intensely.  Then see what happens.  Most of my
friends who are put on that diet have very pleasant careers."
- Ray Bradbury

"Write."
- Ted Lilley
