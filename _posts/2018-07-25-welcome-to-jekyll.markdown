You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it
and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in
many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`,
which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file
is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that
follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the
necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get
an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %} def print\_hi(name) puts "Hi, \#{name}" end
print\_hi('Tom') \#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT. {% endhighlight %}
