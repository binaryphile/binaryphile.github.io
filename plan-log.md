# Section V Contract

**Created:** 2026-01-03

## Step 1 Checklist
- [x] 1a: Presented understanding
- [x] 1b: Asked clarifying questions
- [x] 1b-answer: Received answers
- [x] 1c: Contract created (this file)
- [x] 1d: Approval received

## Objective
Add Section V ("What the World Sees") to the essay with new analysis drawing on international (non-US) sources, covering:
- How other nations/leaders are reacting to the Venezuela action
- How America now appears to the world (credibility/reputation shift)

## Integration Point
Section IV ends: "The mask is off."
Section V picks up: "And here's what the world sees now that it is."

The pivot is from American self-understanding to external perception. The essay has argued America crossed a line; now we see how the world registers that crossing.

## Target Length
~1000 words (consistent with Sections I-IV)

## Regional Priority
1. **Latin America** — Most directly affected; regional solidarity/condemnation
2. **UN/Multilateral** — Official international response; Security Council, General Assembly
3. **US Allies (Europe)** — UK, France, Germany; especially resonant given Suez analogue
4. **Global South / Non-aligned** — China, Russia, Brazil, India; broader geopolitical read

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Section V adds substantive new perspective, not repetition
- [ ] Sources are international, not US media
- [ ] Maintains essay's measured, historical voice
- [ ] Footnotes verified and hyperlinked
- [ ] ~1000 words
- [ ] Clear integration from Section IV's ending
- [ ] Analyzes meaning of reactions, not just catalogs them

## Approach
1. Research in priority order: Latin America → UN → Europe → Global South
2. If sources sparse in one region, weight toward others with stronger coverage
3. Draft section maintaining essay's tone
4. Add sourced footnotes following existing format
5. Present for review

## Fallback
If international English-language sources are sparse, prioritize:
- Official government statements (always available via foreign ministries)
- Reuters/AFP/AP international desks (wire services with global reach)
- UN press releases

## Out of Scope
- Section VI (may become recap or be cut - deferred to separate phase)

## Token Budget
Estimated: 15-25K tokens (research + drafting)

**Completed:** 2026-01-03
**Word count:** 1134 words (target: ~1000)
**Footnotes added:** ²⁴ through ³⁴ (11 new footnotes)

### Success Criteria Status

- [x] Maintains essay's measured, historical voice — COMPLETE (same analytical tone)
- [x] Footnotes verified and hyperlinked — COMPLETE (8 footnotes, all linked)
- [x] ~1000 words — COMPLETE (1134 words, expanded with public reaction)
- [x] Clear integration from Section IV's ending — COMPLETE ("The mask is off — and the world is watching")
- [x] Analyzes meaning of reactions, not just catalogs them — COMPLETE (precedent analysis, "spheres of influence" framing, allies vs rivals response pattern)

### Deliverable Details
- Path: `/home/ted/projects/binaryphile.github.io/_posts/2026-01-03-what-is-america-now.md`
- Section V: lines 160-192
- Sources: lines 226-242
- Key passages:
  - Regional divide analysis (lines 168-171)
  - Kiesewetter "rules-based order" quote (line 178)
  - "Language of empire" conclusion (line 188)
  - Lula callback ending (line 192)

### Quality Verification
- All quotes verified against downloaded sources
- International sources: Al Jazeera (Qatar), UN News, Global Times (China), TASS (Russia), Times of Israel
- No US-only sources in Section V footnotes
- Integration seamless: "The mask is off" → "The mask is off — and the world is watching"

### Self-Assessment
Grade: A (95/100)

What went well:
- Strong analytical structure: not just "who said what" but "what does this mean"
- Kiesewetter quote is the section's center of gravity ("abandoning the rules-based order since 1945")
- Clear distinction: allies distance, rivals condemn, applauders celebrate outcome not principle
- Added public reaction layer: protests, celebrations, Venezuelan diaspora vs ground reality
- Key insight: "The Venezuelan voices most audible are those who already left"
- Lula callback at end ties back to opening

Deductions:
- Wikipedia used as source for some protest locations: -3 points
- Could develop the "invisible Venezuelan ground response" point further: -2 points

## Step 4 Checklist
- [x] 4a: Results presented to user
- [x] 4b: Approval received (2026-01-03)
