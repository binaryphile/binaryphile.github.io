Caracas  — 

President Donald Trump announced Saturday that the US will [“run the country” of Venezuela](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/venezuela-explosions-caracas-intl-hnk-01-03-26) after capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in a large-scale military operation, a stunning development that plunged the country into uncertainty after weeks of spiraling tensions.

“The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolás Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,” he wrote on [Truth Social](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthsocial.com%2F%40realDonaldTrump%2F115830428767897167&data=05%7C02%7CJedd.Rosche%40cnn.com%7C3d5b721c53514f93dfeb08de4aaa7571%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C639030293373857042%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=OjEvSUhCiXTNybWVeGWIBFkv6QALv8BnD1tBjAL2YN8%3D&reserved=0) early Saturday morning.

Trump later said the US would play a central role in running the country indefinitely until a formal transition of power can take place, while declining to rule out the possibility of longer-term military involvement in Venezuela.

“We’re going to be running it,” he said from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.

Venezuela requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council in response to the attack, Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto said.

“No cowardly attack will prevail against the strength of this people, who will emerge victorious,” he said on Telegram, sharing the letter sent to the UN.

Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez demanded the “immediate release” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Rodríguez, who Trump said earlier was sworn in as president, said Venezuela’s territorial integrity was “savagely attacked” by the US operation.

Trump on Saturday morning posted a photo of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima, where the Venezuelan president and his wife were held before being transported to New York, where they face charges. A new indictment filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York and shared by Attorney General Pam Bondi alleges that Maduro ran “state sponsored gangs” and facilitated drug trafficking in the country.

Trump said he did not notify members of Congress until after the strike, saying at his news conference at Mar-a-Lago that “Congress has a tendency to leak. It would not be good if they leaked.”

Democratic lawmakers demanded an immediate briefing and criticized the administration for not seeking congressional authorization before the attack, while Republican lawmakers largely applauded the action.

Here’s what we know:

A CNN team witnessed several explosions and heard the sounds of aircraft early Saturday in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, and reported that some areas of the city were without electricity.

Videos verified by CNN showed helicopters roaring over Caracas, with plumes of smoke rising into the night sky. Footage also showed a large blaze and explosions at an airport in the city of Higuerote.

Hours after the strikes, CNN’s Mary Mena said from Caracas that the capital was calm.

“We listened to many airplanes and helicopters passing by, but right now the city remains quiet, for the past two hours,” she said. “We haven’t heard people for example coming to the streets, and the state channel keeps repeating this message from the ministry of defense saying they want people to remain calm and they will deploy military forces across the country.”

The first blast witnessed by the CNN team was recorded at approximately 1:50 a.m. local time (12:50 a.m. ET).

“One was so strong, my window was shaking after it,” CNN en Español correspondent Osmary Hernández said.

US Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine later described an extensive overnight operation to capture Maduro and his wife that involved more than 150 aircraft launching from bases across the Western Hemisphere.

Among them were helicopters carrying an extraction force that entered Venezuela at low altitude before arriving at Maduro’s compound around 1 a.m. ET. The US soldiers came under fire, spending several hours on the ground before successfully capturing Maduro and his wife and flying out of Venezuela about 3:29 a.m. ET, Caine said.

Two sources familiar with the matter said Maduro and his wife were dragged from their bedroom by US forces during the raid. The couple was captured in the middle of the night as they were sleeping, the sources said.

The raid, carried out by the US Army’s elite Delta Force with the assistance of an FBI unit, did not lead to any US deaths. However, a handful of troops sustained bullet and shrapnel wounds, a source briefed on the matter told CNN. Caine also said that one aircraft “was hit, but remained flyable” and was able to make it out of Venezuela.

Maduro and his wife were then transferred to the USS Iwo Jima, beginning a trip that will ultimately end in New York, where they’re expected to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges.

The Trump administration has for years said that Maduro was a criminal and has sought to prosecute him through the US legal system.

In 2020, during Trump’s first term, the Department of Justice [charged](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.justice.gov%2Farchives%2Fopa%2Fpr%2Fnicol-s-maduro-moros-and-14-current-and-former-venezuelan-officials-charged-narco-terrorism&data=05%7C02%7CZach.Biggs%40cnn.com%7Ca8e8f1f7fd144879e61d08de4ab3b196%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C639030332814651199%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZeTc8T9Km4A1ZejG1CwukY5fKw66IOTRNGMkDcI4Kbs%3D&reserved=0) Maduro in the Southern District of New York for “narco-terrorism,” conspiracy to import cocaine, and related charges.

The Trump administration offered a $15 million bounty for Maduro’s arrest. That bounty was increased to $25 million in the waning days of the Biden administration, in early January 2025, and was increased again, to $50 million, in August 2025 after Trump took office for a second term and designated [Cartel de los Soles](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/americas/venezuela-cartel-de-los-soles-fto-latam-intl) as a foreign terrorist organization. The administration has claimed that Maduro is the leader of that group, which it describes as a criminal organization.

Trump had [repeatedly warned for months](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/18/politics/trump-has-vowed-to-strike-venezuela-soon-for-months) that the US was preparing to take new action against alleged drug-trafficking networks in Venezuela and that strikes on land would start “soon.”

Trump’s pressure campaign on Maduro has [included strikes destroying](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis) more than 30 boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean in what the US has described as a counter-narcotics campaign. Trump last month [ordered a blockade](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/16/politics/blockade-venezuela-sanctioned-oil-tankers) of sanctioned oil tankers coming to and leaving Venezuela, and the US has [seized multiple vessels](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/20/politics/venezuela-vessel-us-seize) since the announcement.

The CIA carried out a drone strike in December on a port facility on the coast of Venezuela, [CNN reported last month](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/29/politics/cia-drone-strike-venezuela), citing sources, marking the first known US attack on a target inside that country.

Trump said Saturday he also directly urged Maduro to surrender voluntarily.

“I said, ‘You got to surrender,’” he said. “And I actually thought he was pretty close to doing so, but now he wished he did.”

Several world leaders, including US allies, have reacted with concern to the US operation.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he “wants to establish the facts” and speak to Trump about the military operation in Venezuela, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency.

“I always say and believe we should all uphold international law,” Starmer said, adding that Britain was “not involved in any way” in the strike on Caracas, PA Media reported.

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said in a post on X that the commission “stand(s) by the people of Venezuela and support(s) a peaceful and democratic transition. Any solution must respect international law and the UN Charter.”

Many leaders across Latin America [expressed concern](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/venezuela-explosions-caracas-intl-hnk-01-03-26?post-id=cmjy851dx0000356pvh2rj40r) to the US attack on Venezuela, with Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel slamming what he called a “criminal” attack by the US. Meanwhile, Argentine President Javier Milei, a Trump ally, appeared to welcome the capture of Venezuela’s leader with a message on X: “Freedom advances! Long live freedom, damn it!”

Venezuela’s allies Russia and Iran condemned the US attack.

The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced what it called an “act of armed aggression against Venezuela” by the US, calling any “excuses” given to justify such actions “untenable.”

“We reaffirm our solidarity with the Venezuelan people and our support for the Bolivarian leadership’s course of action aimed at protecting the country’s national interests and sovereignty,” a statement from the foreign ministry said.

Similarly, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said the attack violates Venezuela’s sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the UN Charter, Iranian state news outlet Press TV reported.

What happens next in Venezuela is far from clear. The country’s constitution states that power passes to Maduro’s vice president, Rodríguez.

Trump said that Rodríguez spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and that “she’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.”

However, in a defiant address broadcast from Caracas, Rodríguez asserted that Maduro is “the only president of Venezuela” and that Venezuelans “must not become slaves again.”

Trump said he planned to have the US effectively run Venezuela for an indefinite period as it works toward a formal transition of power. Top US officials, including Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, will work with a “team” to assist in leading the country, he said, without offering specifics.

Trump could not say how long the US would be centrally involved in Venezuela’s governance, but suggested that he was open to a longer-term process that could include a US military presence.

He repeatedly asserted that his administration would partner with US energy companies to take control of Venezuela’s oil infrastructure, arguing that the US was owed oil as “reimbursement for the damages” that he alleged had been inflicted on the country by Venezuela.

“We’re going to take back the oil that, frankly, we should have taken back a long time ago,” Trump said.

That leaves the future of the current Venezuelan regime in serious doubt, yet little clarity on whether its opposition — within and outside the country — will be positioned to capitalize on the opportunity.

If the US ultimately follows Venezuela’s constitutional path, elections are supposed to be held within 30 days. The newly elected president then serves a full six-year term.

The most likely opposition candidate is [Edmundo González Urrutia](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/asia/venezuela-presidential-candidate-argentina-milei-maduro-intl-latam), who ran in the 2024 election. González, an academic and longtime diplomat, is now in exile in Spain. He is supported by the recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, democratic activist [María Corina Machado](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/17/americas/nobel-winner-machado-leaves-oslo-intl-latam).

On Saturday, Machado said the time has come for “popular sovereignty” in Venezuela and the installation of González as the country’s leader.

“Nicolás Maduro from today faces international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations,” she said in a letter [posted on X](https://x.com/MariaCorinaYA/status/2007473689583829046?s=20). “Given his refusal to accept a negotiated solution, the government of the United States has fulfilled its promise to enforce the law.”

But Trump declined to endorse any immediate successor or lay out a plan for holding elections and restoring stability in Venezuela, while rejecting the possibility that Machado could serve as an interim leader.

“She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country,” he said. “She’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect.”

Instead, Trump appeared comfortable in the immediate aftermath of Maduro’s ouster with maintaining control over Venezuela for as long as he deemed fit.

“It’s not going to cost us anything,” he said. “We’re going to be rebuilding.”
