Saturday's capture of [Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/03/trump-says-us-captured-venezuelan-president-nicolas-maduro) isn't the first time the U.S. entered a Latin American country by force to seize its leader on drugs charges.

**Why it matters:** What comes next is likely years of court battles over how Maduro is charged, how he's treated and where he's held.

**Flashback:** In December 1989, the U.S. [invaded Panama](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/20/world/us-troops-move-in-panama-in-effort-to-seize-noriega-gunfire-is-heard-in-capital.html), accusing dictator Manuel Noriega of drug trafficking and other crimes.

-   Noriega surrendered in January 1990 to American forces, who brought him back to the U.S. for trial.
-   As opposed to the lightning-fast seizure of Maduro, Noriega's capture took weeks, during which time he holed up in the Vatican's embassy. (U.S. troops notoriously blasted the embassy with [loud rock music](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40090809) to annoy him into surrender.)

**The intrigue:** Once in the U.S., Noriega fought a yearslong court battle to be considered a prisoner of war, rather than a common criminal.

-   Noriega ultimately won that fight and was [declared](https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/drawing-justice-courtroom-illustrations/about-this-exhibition/crime-corruption-and-cover-ups/manuel-noriega-on-trial/) a POW, rather than a regular inmate. That entitled him to certain privileges like wearing his uniform and being housed in less restrictive conditions.
-   After 20 years in U.S. custody he was [extradited](https://abcnews.go.com/International/Blotter/panamas-dictator-manuel-noriega-extradited-us-france/story?id=10486776) to France, and later returned to Panama, where he died in 2017.

**Between the lines:** Trump administration officials for months have compared Maduro —also indicted for drug trafficking— to Noriega.

-   The Panama invasion, like this military action, was not authorized by Congress.

-   "This could be Noriega part 2," an official [told](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/29/venezuela-ships-trump-maduro-regime-change) Axios in August.

**Where it stands:** Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) [posted](https://x.com/BasedMikeLee/status/2007395531023352319) to X early Saturday morning that he was told Maduro would be brought to the U.S. to stand criminal trial.

-   But he offered no further details on when, where or how.

**What to watch:** It wasn't clear as of early Saturday where Maduro would be held, or tried.

-   "They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts," Attorney General Pam Bondi [said](https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2007427147468882325?s=20) of Maduro and his wife.
-   But the legal saga is all but certain to take years to play out.
